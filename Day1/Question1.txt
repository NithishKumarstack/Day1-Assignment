//Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

introduction:
The evolution of the internet has led to significant advancements in web technologies and protocols
Among them, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) plays a vital role in facilitating communication between web clients and servers.
HTTP/1.1 has been the predominant protocol for many years, but with the introduction of HTTP/2, new possibilities emerged
offering improved performance and enhanced user experiences. In this blog post, we will explore the key differences
between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 and understand how these changes impact web browsing.

1. Multiplexing and Request Prioritization:
One of the significant enhancements in HTTP/2 is the introduction of multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and
responses to be exchanged simultaneously over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP/1.1, where requests had to be made sequentially,
HTTP/2 enables concurrent streams, eliminating the need for multiple connections. This leads to more efficient resource
utilization, reduces latency, and improves overall page load times. Moreover, HTTP
enabling the client to specify the importance of each request, ensuring critical resources are delivered first.

2. Header Compression:
In HTTP/1.1, each request and response included headers containing valuable information about the data being transmitted.
However, these headers often contained redundant or repetitive information, resulting in increased overhead and slower performance,
HTTP/2 addresses this issue by introducing header compression using the HPACK algorithm. With header compression,
the size of headers is significantly reduced, leading to reduced bandwidth consumption and faster data transfer.

3. Server Push:
Another notable feature of HTTP/2 is server push. Traditionally, web browsers had to send a request to the server for each resource
required to render a webpage, which could lead to delays due to round-trip times.
HTTP/2 allows servers to push resources to the client proactively, based on the server's anticipation of the client's needs.
This eliminates the need for additional requests, reducing latency and improving the overall page load speed.

4. Binary Protocol:
HTTP/1.1 uses plain text for data transmission, which is human-readable but not as efficient as binary formats.
HTTP/2, on the other hand, employs a binary protocol, which offers better parsing and processing efficiency.
The binary framing layer in HTTP/2 enables faster and more reliable data transfer, as well as improved error handling.
However, the binary nature of HTTP/2 makes it harder to debug and troubleshoot compared to the text-based HTTP/1.1.

5. Compatibility and Adoption:
HTTP/2 is designed to be fully backward-compatible with HTTP/1.1, ensuring that older clients and servers can still communicate
with HTTP/2-enabled ones. This means that even if a server supports HTTP/2,
support the newer protocol.

Conclusion:
HTTP/2 brings several improvements over its predecessor, HTTP/1.1, revolutionizing the way web content is delivered.
By introducing multiplexing, header compression, server push, and a binary protocol, HTTP/2 enhances performance, reduces latency,
and optimizes bandwidth usage. As more websites and web servers adopt HTTP/2, users can expect faster and more efficient 
web experiences. It is crucial for developers and web administrators to understand these differences and consider migrating to 
HTTP/2 to leverage its benefits fully.
